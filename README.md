# Zombie-Strike
3 month project at Full Sail University

This repo contains runnable exe with all assets as well as folder with all source code written by developers that worked on the game.

Source code will not be able to be compiled because for the class we were given a premade wrapper set that we do not have permission to release to the public. 
That being said, source code was added for proof of programming abilities.

To run game, download Runnable Exe folder and you should be able to simply run the exe as is.

Thanks for viewing!
